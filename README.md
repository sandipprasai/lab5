This project is a web application that predicts the weight of a fish based on its species and physical measurements.
Here's how it works:
Machine Learning Model: The core of the application is a pre-trained machine learning model (presumably trained on a dataset of fish species, lengths, heights, widths and corresponding weights). This model is loaded by the Flask application when it starts.
User Interface: The web interface provides a simple form for users to input the fish's:
Species (represented as a numerical value 0-5)
Length1 (in cm)
Length2 (in cm)
Length3 (in cm)
Height (in cm)
Width (in cm)
Prediction Request: Upon submitting the form, the user's input is sent to the Flask backend (/predict route) as a JSON object.
Prediction and Response: The backend preprocesses the input, uses the loaded machine learning model to make a weight prediction, and sends the predicted weight back to the user interface.
Result Display: The predicted weight is displayed on the webpage.
Project Structure:
app.py: Contains the main Flask application logic, including:
Loading the machine learning model.
Defining the routes for the homepage (/) and the prediction endpoint (/predict).
Handling user input, prediction, and error management.
index.html: Provides the HTML structure and styling for the user interface, including the input form and result display area. It also contains JavaScript code to handle form submission and interaction with the Flask backend.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python libraries required to run the application.
runtime.txt: Specifies the Python runtime environment for the application.
wsgi.py: A simple WSGI application object to run the Flask app.
Getting Started:
Install Dependencies: Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the necessary Python libraries.
Replace Placeholder Model: Make sure to replace fish_weight_predictor_model.pkl with your trained machine learning model file.
Run the Application: Execute flask run to start the Flask development server.
This project provides a basic structure for a machine learning-powered web application. You can extend it further by:
Improving the Model: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
Enhancing the UI: Create a more visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Adding Features: Include additional features like data visualizations or the ability to handle different fish species.
